## Reporting a Vulnerability

If a major vulnerability bug is found that poses a risk to current users of the software, then a new issue should first has to be created.
This issue should **NOT SHOW DETAILS** about the vulnerability itself. Via the issue a possibility to report the vulnerability only to the maintainers is provided. 
In order to notice the vulnerability even faster, we also ask you to start the title with `[CRITICAL]`.
